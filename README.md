# Hello and goodmorning! 
My name is Edgar Zambrana and I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer based in the Orlando, FL area!

<br>

Ever since I was a little kid I have always known that I wanted to be part of this career field. A piece of advice that I was told growing up was to "pick a job a that you love so that work doesn't feel like work but something you WANT to do. Something to get up in the morning for". Having now spent over three years professonally as an engineer and about 5 overall programming, I can wholeheartedly say that I truly love what I do and it really is a pleasure to wake up and get to code!

<br>

## Experience
As of right now, my experience consists of using technologies such Angular/React/Next.JS for the front-end and using Spring Boot/Node.JS for the back-end. I also have experience in developer tooling such as pipelines with Jenkins or pipelines with GitHub Actions, using cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure, and scripting experience with Python and Shell scripts.

## Languages/Frameworks
I am familiar with multiple languages and frameworks including but not limited to: Java, C#, Ruby, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Angular, Spring Boot, React, .NET, Next.JS, TailwindCSS, Rails, GitHub Actions, Git & GitHub, etc. I will never turn down an opportunity to pick up a new one for your needs or for the companies needs!
