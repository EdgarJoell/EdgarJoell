# Hello and goodmorning! 
Iâ€™m @EdgarJoell, aka Edgar J. Zambrana and I am Full-Stack Software Engineer.

<br>

Ever since I was a little kid, I've ALWAYS known that I wanted to have a career in the technology field but I didn't which part exactly. I didn't know until I took my first programming class in high school and ever since then, I knew I wanted to a software engineer. It didn't matter to me which branch of software engineering but I felt in my heart that I NEEDED to have a career as a programmer. 

I'm ready to start my career. I am open to learning new languages, frameworks, and libraries to fit the needs of the company/customer.
